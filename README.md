# USB I3C* Library for Linux* OS

## About

The **USB I3C\* Library for Linux\* OS** is a C user-space library to communicate with I3C devices behind a USB I3C device. It is intended to be used by developers to facilitate the development of a host software stack to control and communicate with the USB I3C device.

It allows a host to connectÂ to an I3C controller within a USB I3C device to configure and initialize an I3C bus and its target devices. It allows the host to send commands and write/read data to/from I3C or I2C target devices synchronously or asynchronously. And allows the host to handle In-band Interrupts sent by I3C target devices with user defined actions.

The library implements the operational model and data structures described in the [USB I3C Device Class specification](https://www.usb.org/document-library/usb-i3c-device-class-specification).

## Supported Platforms
 - Linux

## Building Dependencies

The following dependencies need to be installed to build the library:
 - cmake
 - libusb
 - doxygen (only if building the documentation)
 - cmocka (only if building the tests)

## Building The Library

Create a build directory:
`$ mkdir build`

Configure the build:
`$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -B build/`

Optionally, you can also enable building the library's documentation and code samples:
`$ cmake -DDOCUMENTATION=ON -DBUILD_SAMPLES=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -B build/`

Build the binary:
`$ cmake --build build/`

## Installing The Library

To install the library in the default location (*`/usr/local`*) you can run the install target:
`$ cmake --build build/ --target install`

You can install the library in a different location by specifying it using the *`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`* variable.

Likewise, uninstalling the binaries from the system can be done using the uninstall target:
`cmake --build build/ --target uninstall`

## Getting Started

With the library installed, all you need is to reference the usbi3c header in your source.

Please refer to the [code samples](./examples) to see examples of using the library.

For further information please build and read the library's documentation.
